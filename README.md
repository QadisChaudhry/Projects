# Projects

All of the projects that have seen work over the years from full programs to introductory work.

Notes:
  - open-supreme was used as inspiration and a guide to working with HTTPS requests within Python.
  - AI_learning was initially from the YouTuber "CodeBullet" and used as a framework for understanding the genetic algorithm and machine learning.
